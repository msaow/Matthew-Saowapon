<h1>Climber</h1>
<p>On the weekend I love exploring the mountains with my friends.</p>
<p>One of my highlights is our trip up <a href="https://athousandhilltops.com/mt-kitchener-and-snow-dome/">Kitchener and Snow Dome</a> at the end of my first backcountry season. I spent the year working hard to gain the technical skills and experience required to plan our very own trip up the Colombia Icefield. There were a lot of crashes and terrifying moments in the process, but it paid off with great memories in spectacular places.</p>
