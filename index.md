I work at [ACWA](https://www.ucalgary.ca/acwa/) developing analytical methods to measure emerging contaminants in the environment. My current focus is a GC-MS method to quantify plasticizers in municipal wastewater.

On the weekend I love exploring the mountains with my friends.

One of my highlights is our trip up [Kitchener and Snow Dome](https://athousandhilltops.com/mt-kitchener-and-snow-dome/) at the end of my first backcountry season. I spent the year working hard to gain the technical skills and experience required to plan our very own trip up the Colombia Icefield. There were a lot of crashes and terrifying moments in the process, but it paid off with great memories and beautiful places.
